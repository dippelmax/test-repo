Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. 
Here’s one who thinks he is the master of others, yet he is more enslaved than they are. 
How did this change come about? I don’t know. 
What can make it legitimate? 
That’s a question that I think I can answer.


The most ancient of all societies, and the only natural one, is the society of the family.
Yet the children remain attached to the father only for as long as they need him for their preservation; as soon as this need ceases, the natural bond is dissolved.
The children, released from the obedience they owed to the father, and the father, released from the care he owed his children, return equally to independence.
If they remain united, this is something they do not naturally but voluntarily, and the family itself is then maintained only by agreement.
